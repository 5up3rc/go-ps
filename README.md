# Process List Library for Go

go-ps is a library for Go that implements OS-specific APIs to list and
manipulate processes in a platform-safe way.

**Project status:** This library is being used in production systems
at [HashiCorp](http://www.hashicorp.com) with Linux. It is missing a
lot of functionality since we prioritized what we needed first, but it
should be easy to add others.
